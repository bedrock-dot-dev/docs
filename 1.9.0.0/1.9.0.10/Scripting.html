<h1><p id="Scripting System">Scripting System</p></h1>

The Minecraft Script Engine uses the JavaScript language.</br>You can write JavaScript scripts and bundle them with Behavior Packs to listen and respond to game events, get and modify data in components that entities have, and affect different parts of the game.</br><h1><p id="Demos">Demos</p></h1>

Here are some demos from your friends at Minecraft to help you get started with scripting. Simply unzip them to check out the code, or import them as a .mcpack to play with them</br><h2></h2>

<h1><p id="Getting Started">Getting Started</p></h1>

First you will need to download the latest Vanilla Behavior Pack. You can get this from the following link: https://aka.ms/behaviorpacktemplate </br>Once you have downloaded the Behavior Pack, unzip it to a folder. Inside the Behavior Pack you will find the scripts folder which contains all the scripting files you want to run.</br>In the scripts folder you will find two folders: one for client scripts and one for server scripts.</br>-Server Scripts: These scripts run on the server side of the game. This includes spawning new entities, adding components, or modifying components on an entity.</br>-Client Scripts: These scripts run on each individual player's side of the game. This is a good place to respond to events and manage anything specific to the player.</br>Once you have chosen whether you are making a client or server script, simply add a new blank text file with .js extension to the appropriate folder, and open it in your preferred code editor. Then code away! You can have as many or as few JavaScript files as you want here (the name of the files doesn't matter) and they will all be run independently of each other!</br></br> NOTE: For scripts to be run by the game, you need to enable Experimental Gameplay on the world where you will run scripts on. This will be necessary while scripting is still in beta.</br>When entering a world that has client scripts in it, you will be prompted to accept that you wish to run scripts on your device (this will show up both for local worlds as well as multiplayer worlds).</br><h2>Folder Structure</h2>

<h1><p id="Structure of a Script">Structure of a Script</p></h1>

In this section you can find a quick description of the basic structure of a JavaScript script file for the Minecraft Script Engine. If you would like to learn more about JavaScript or want to follow a fundamentals tutorial, you can check the official documentation on the Mozilla Developer Network here: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript </br>These are, in a way, the required parts of a script but they are by no means the only parts you can have. You can create additional methods as needed - just make sure they are called from somewhere in one of the methods below!</br><h2></h2>

<h2><p id="1. System Registration">1. System Registration</p></h2>

First off we need to register the system for our file. This signs up our script to be set-up either on the client or server threads of the game. Generally speaking, you will choose based on whether you put the script file in the client or server folders. To do that simply call registerSystem on either the client or server and give it the version of the API you require.</br><h3>Parameters</h3>

<h3>Code Examples:</h3>

Server System<br / ><textarea readonly="true" cols="54" rows="2">
let sampleServerSystem = server.registerSystem(0, 0);
</textarea> </br>
<a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h2><p id="2. System Initialization">2. System Initialization</p></h2>

This is the first method that gets called immediately after the system is registered. It will run as soon as the script loads at world start.</br>You can use this to set up the environment for your script: register custom components and events, sign up event listeners, etc. This will run BEFORE the world is ready and the player has been added to it, so you shouldn't try to spawn any entities here!</br><h3>Code Example:</h3>
<br / ><textarea readonly="true" cols="39" rows="4">
sampleSystem.initialize = function() {
	//Initialize all the things
};
</textarea> </br>
<a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h2><p id="3. System Update">3. System Update</p></h2>

This method gets called once every game tick. The server and client tick at 20 times per second. This is a good place to get, check, and react to component changes.</br><h3>Code Example:</h3>
<br / ><textarea readonly="true" cols="35" rows="4">
sampleSystem.update = function() {
	//Update all the things
};
</textarea> </br>
<a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h2><p id="4. System Shutdown">4. System Shutdown</p></h2>

This method gets called when the Minecraft Script Engine is shutting down. For the client this is when they leave the world; for the server this is after the last player has exited the world.</br><h3>Code Example:</h3>
<br / ><textarea readonly="true" cols="37" rows="4">
sampleSystem.shutdown = function() {
	//Cleanup all the things
};
</textarea> </br>

<h1><p id="Debugging">Debugging</p></h1>

Your script isn't working or doing what you want it to do? Fret not! We have built some debugging capabilities into the Script Engine to help you figure out what's going on with your script. If you are new to programming or want to learn more about debugging we suggest checking out the documentation about debugging with Visual Studio available here: https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger </br></br>There are two ways to tell what happened when something goes wrong with a script: in-game and advanced, which we will describe below. You only need the game and your script to debug in-game, but you will need a Windows 10 PC and Visual Studio installed for the advanced debugging.</br><h2></h2>

<h2><p id="In-Game">In-Game</p></h2>

When you run a script in the game, the Script Engine will print out error messages whenever something goes wrong. For example, if you try to get a component that the script engine doesn't know about you will get an error.</br>To look at these messages you can open the chat screen which will have all the generated error messages there; or you can open the log file that the game generated. The location of the log file varies by platform. On Windows 10 you can find the log file in ' %APPDATA%\..\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\logs '</br>We strongly encourage you to build further debug messages and tools into your scripts while working on them. This will help you discern when something isn't working quite right. Reach out on the official Discord channel if you need additional help: https://discord.gg/Minecraft</br><a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h2><p id="Real-Time (Advanced)">Real-Time (Advanced)</p></h2>

If you have a Windows 10 PC with Visual Studio installed, you can attach the Visual Studio debugger and debug your script in real-time.</br>If you installed Visual Studio with the components mentioned in the "Recommended" section of this document you will have installed and enabled the Just-In-Time Debugger. This tool will pop-up a message from Visual Studio whenever an exception occurs in your script and allow you to open Visual Studio on the line of your script that broke.</br></br>Additionally, you can connect to the Script Engine manually and debug your code. You can use remote debugging to connect and debug Minecraft running on another device. Please refer to the Visual Studio Debugger documentation above for instructions on how to use remote debugging.</br>First you need to start up Visual Studio. If this is the first time you have launched Visual Studio after installation, we suggest setting up your environment for JavaScript development and logging in to your Microsoft account when prompted. This will set up the Visual Studio interface with the most important tools you will need.</br>Once you have Visual Studio open you should launch Minecraft. Then create a new world with Experimental Gameplay enabled and apply the Behavior Pack containing your scripts.</br>After creating the world go back to Visual Studio and click on the Debug menu. Then click on "Attach to Process". In the window that opens there will be a search box titled Filter Process. Click on it and type Minecraft.</br>Once the list is narrowed down to only the instance of Minecraft running, you can verify that the Script Engine is running by looking at the Type column. This will say Script and either x86 or x64.</br></br>Select the process and click on Attach to attach the debugger to the game. Now you will be able to press the Pause button to pause the Script Engine when the next line of script code runs. This allows you to inspect the values of variables in your script and break into Visual Studio if an error occurs in your code.</br>WARNING: When you hit a breakpoint to step through code with a debugger, it is possible for a client to time out and disconnect or for the server to disconnect all players.</br><a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

Entity Queries are a way for you to filter for entities based on their components. Once you have registered a query, you can request all the entities that are captured by it. Entity Queries will only ever return entities that are currently active in the level. If your query extends into chunks that are not currently loaded, entities there will not be included in the query.</br><h2></h2>

<h2><p id="registerQuery()">registerQuery()</p></h2>

Allows you to register a query. A query will contain all entities that meet the filter requirement.</br>No filters are added by default when you register a query so it will capture all entities.</br><h3></h3>

<h1><p id="Script Components">Script Components</p></h1>

This is the documentation for the attributes, properties, and components available from the Minecraft Script Engine.</br>There are two kinds of components: server components and client components. We will go into a bit more detail on what they are in their respective sections below.</br>Components can be added, retrieved, updated, and removed from entities. They do not exist on their own. Currently only user-defined components can be added and removed from entities. A component must be in an entity in order to retrieve or update it.</br>Check the Script Engine Bindings section to see how to add, remove, retrieve, and update components. This section deals with the specific API of each component.</br><h1><p id="Client Components">Client Components</p></h1>

These components only run on the client where the script ran and can only be used from client scripts.</br><h2></h2>

<h2><p id="minecraft:molang">minecraft:molang</p></h2>

The MoLang component gives access to the MoLang variables in an entity. To learn more about MoLang varibles review the add-on documentation. In scripts, you can get and set these varibles that are defined in the entity's JSON files. Because of how the MoLang variables are formatted (variable.isgrazing for example) you must use the [] operator on the object to access the variable. The example below shows how to use the [] operator to access the variable.</br><h3>Code Example:</h3>
<br / ><textarea readonly="true" cols="73" rows="5">
let molangComponent = this.createComponent(entity, "minecraft:molang"); 
molangComponent["variable.molangexample"] = 1.0; 
this.applyComponentChanges(molangComponent); 

</textarea> </br>

<h1><p id="Server Components">Server Components</p></h1>

These are the components that run on the server and are synced with all the clients (players) in the world.</br>As much as possible, the API of each component matches its JSON counterpart (with some differences noted).</br><h2></h2>

<h2><p id="minecraft:attack">minecraft:attack</p></h2>

This component controls the Attack Damage attribute from the entity. It allows you to change the current minimum and maximum values. Once the changes are applied, the current attack of the entity will be reset to the minimum specified. With the minimum and maximum changed to the values specified. Any buffs or debuffs will be left intact.</br><h3>Parameters</h3>

<h2><p id="minecraft:collision_box">minecraft:collision_box</p></h2>

Controls the collision box of the entity. When changes to the component are applied the entity's collision box is immediately updated to reflect the new dimensions. WARNING: If the change of the collision box dimensions would cause the entity to be inside a block, the entity might become stuck there and start suffocating.</br><h3>Parameters</h3>

<h1><p id="User-Defined Components">User-Defined Components</p></h1>

User-Defined components are a special kind of component that can be defined in script and no built-in game system acts on it.</br>The component needs to be registered with the Script Engine by giving it a name and a set of fields in the format name:value. Once applied, the component behaves like any of the built-in components: you can get it from an entity, modify its values, and apply the changes.</br>Currently User-Defined components are the only components that can be dynamically added and removed from an entity using scripts. They don't need to be previously defined in an entity's JSON file. In the current version these components will NOT be saved out or loaded back in: they only exist while the entity is there and need to be added back when reloading the level.</br><h2>Code Example:</h2>
